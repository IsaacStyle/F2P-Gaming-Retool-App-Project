# F2P-Gaming-Retool-App-Project
#### A Management Tool for a Free To Play Gaming Database that uses the Retool App to perform CRUD operations with less hassle.

##### The App will list all the Api Data within an easy to read and operate table, from which you can both update and delete any entry. 
##### The navigation bar consists of drop down menus which will filter the table by a specific Platform or Genre, as well as search any game by Title.
##### Lastly, at the bottom of the page you will find a create form which will allow you to create new data for the Api.
